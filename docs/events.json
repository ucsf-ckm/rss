Since early 2025 several federal research datasets have been altered or deleted in response to executive orders from the White House. These actions have raised significant concerns about the accessibility and integrity of government data. For example, in February, several datasets from the US Census Bureau suddenly became unavailable, and others from the CDC were removed and then later restored. In this presentation, we will explore the latest developments in data censorship and the current efforts to rescue and preserve government datasets. You&rsquo;ll learn about the organizations that have worked to preserve data, alternative sources of government data, and how you can get involved to protect valuable public information.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning.

The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming. The series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session requires UCSF MyAccess credentials.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the instructor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The instructor, Yea-Hung Chen, PhD, MS, has 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience teaching R to the UCSF community. He designed and taught UCSF&#39;s first-ever R course (Biostat 213) and&nbsp;taught the introductory biostatistics course for UCSF&#39;s&nbsp;MS in Global Health program (GHS 207).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

Once considered a radical experiment, open source software is now ubiquitous in the modern technology landscape. In the technology industry, the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is a common way to centralize a company&rsquo;s open source strategy, knowledge, and diligence. Meanwhile, OSPOs are just beginning to take root in academia. While guidance for university OSPOs is emerging, many questions remain about how OSPOs best support their university&rsquo;s strategic priorities and their community&rsquo;s needs. The University of California (UC) OSPO Network is working to develop infrastructure for open source education, discovery, and sustainability at UC by pooling our resources and knowledge. To develop our strategic priorities and to assess the state of UC open source, we conducted a survey in April 2025 of more than 230 UC-affiliated open source contributors. This survey sheds light on how and why academics contribute to open source projects, as well as some of the barriers holding them back.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible.</span></div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\">\n<p style=\"list-style-type:square\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-variant: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\">UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming. The series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session requires UCSF MyAccess credentials.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to host intermediate-level workshops on R in&nbsp;Spring 2025 (dates and details pending).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question.

Next, we will introduce a python based, open-source stack researchers can use to analyze, transcribe, and categorize data in IDL video, audio, and image files.

The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming. The series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session requires UCSF MyAccess credentials.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to host intermediate-level workshops on R in&nbsp;Spring 2025 (dates and details pending).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question.

The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming. The series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session requires UCSF MyAccess credentials.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to host intermediate-level workshops on R in&nbsp;Spring 2025 (dates and details pending).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question. This second&nbsp;session&nbsp;is&nbsp;titled &quot;How can I assign missing values or define dates?&quot; and&nbsp;will cover:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>logical objects</li>\n\t<li>checking for missing values</li>\n\t<li>assigning missing values</li>\n\t<li>Date objects&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>time-series plots</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Participants are strongly encouraged to attend the prior session or familiarze themselves with that session&#39;s content (slides and exercises).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the instructor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The instructor, Yea-Hung Chen, PhD, MS, has 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience teaching R to the UCSF community.

It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming. The series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session requires UCSF MyAccess credentials.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to host intermediate-level workshops on R in&nbsp;Spring 2025 (dates and details pending).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question.

In this hands-on session, participants will learn about important digital methods like GIS mapping, network analysis, and text analysis by engaging with prepared archival data. Rather than throwing these students into a class on how to use a digital tool like ArcGIS or Gephi, this workshop will first teach how digital humanists approach their research objects, and how their questions are based out of a humanist tradition.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Participants will learn:</p>\n\n<p>The basics of a number of digital methods.

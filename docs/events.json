Through documents from the <a href=\"https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/\">UCSF Industry Documents Library</a> &ndash; including essays by CEOs of Big Oil companies and representatives of the plastics industry, federal legal documents, op-eds from print media, and academic research &ndash; Tabancay crafts a narrative that shows industry and economic practices that negatively impact humans and the environment with climate change as the backdrop.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">As many know, hospitals generate vast amounts of waste, especially plastic. This reality has been a driving force behind the work featured in Tabancay&#39;s exhibition, which has been created using discarded plastic materials obtained from the UCSF medical center. The works reflect the consequences of human reliance on plastic and its impact on Earth&rsquo;s native populations.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The Healthcare industry is the second-largest waste generator in the US after the food industry, producing more than 5 million tons of waste each year. Among them, 85% of the waste is non-infectious and ends up in landfills with only a small fraction being recycled and repurposed .</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><a href=\"https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/sustainability/waste-to-art\">UCSF Sustainability website</a></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Tabancay also explored the UCSF Library&rsquo;s physical archives as part of her residency. As a UCSF School of Medicine graduate, she has firsthand experience observing and using modern medical instruments. She found the vintage medical artifacts and their histories compelling, incorporating them into her research.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The exhibition opening is available to UCSF ID badge holders, and admission is FREE. Ruth&#39;s exhibit will be on display through June 2026.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></strong></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

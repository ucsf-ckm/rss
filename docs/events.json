It is also built around the needs of humanists, who sometimes are not trained in computational and digital methods. Students, faculty, and staff are all welcome to attend.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Attendees will need to be able to open Microsoft Excel on their computers, either using a desktop application or web version provided with Microsoft 365.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>UCSF welcomes everyone, including people with disabilities to our events and exhibits.

This workshop is designed to help those scholars feel more comfortable working with those digital tools.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This workshop will provide basic instruction in how to read, navigate, and run simple commands in the Terminal or Command Prompt.

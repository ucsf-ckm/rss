Rowland. Kelly will discuss her experiences as editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS), a journal dedicated to publishing articles about open source research software across domains. JOSS&rsquo; scope includes software that solves complex modeling problems in a scientific context, supports the functioning of research instruments or the execution of research experiments, or extracts knowledge from large data sets. Kelly is a Computer Systems Engineer in the User Engagement Group at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Before joining NERSC, she obtained her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in Nuclear Engineering with a Designated Emphasis on Computational Science and Engineering. Kelly has been an editor for the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) since 2021.</span></span></span></div>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The Bay Area Open Science Group is intended to bring together students, faculty, and staff from the Stanford, UCSF, and Berkeley community to learn about open science, discuss the application of open science practices in a research context, and meet other members of the community who are interested in (or already are) incorporating open science practices into their work.

In Web of Science you can identify articles, find where an author or article has been cited, and find articles an article has cited. In this database, articles are linked by citations.

Throughout Katina&#39;s residency at UCSF, she&nbsp;reviewed the&nbsp;<em>Roundup Litigation Documents&nbsp;</em>within the UCSF Industry Documents Library to select the most poignant parts of the email exchanges between the EPA and Monsanto to include in her photographic project using glyphosate to physically deteriorate C-prints over time as they were buried in the ground. Additionally, she used images from her personal archive of her family&rsquo;s land that underwent the same image treatment and process. The results of these prints varied from partially deteriorated, highlighting specific sections of the print, to completely disintegrated, leaving behind a ghost-like image.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">An augmented reality (AR) project then takes these deterioration patterns and animates them into a virtual work, enabling the viewer to place the deterioration on top of their inhabited land to visualize the detrimental effects instantaneously. A series of letterpress prints also feature the deterioration patterns from the glyphosate-treated archival images and segments of a lake depth chart map of Burt Lake, a frequented fishing spot, commenting on the effects of herbicides to our aquatic ecosystems. The deterioration patterns conceal and highlight various indication symbols on the map, guiding the viewer along their discovery of the map.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Contact the <a href=\"https://www.library.ucsf.edu/ask-an-expert/makers-lab-support/\">Makers Lab</a> if you have questions about this event.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">Image credit: Katina Bitsicas (2023).&nbsp;Glyphosate Dreams&nbsp;[Glyphosate treated C-print from personal archive, 30&rdquo;x40&rdquo;].</span></p>","url":{"public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/event/12367706","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/aevent.php?c=928&m=edit&event_id=12367706"},"location":"Living Room - Main Floor","campus":"Parnassus","category":[{"id":50900,"name":"Archives and Special Collections > Artist in Residence"},{"id":6331,"name":"Archives and Special Collections"},{"id":25201,"name":"Makers Lab"},{"id":29165,"name":"ZSFG"}],"owner":{"id":6745,"name":"UCSF Library Special Events"},"presenter":"Katina Bitsicas, UCSF Library Artist in Residence","calendar":{"id":928,"name":"Library Events and Classes","public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/calendar/events","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/admin/calendar/928"},"seats":100,"registration":true,"has_registration_opened":true,"has_registration_closed":false,"physical_seats":100,"physical_seats_taken":0,"online_seats":0,"online_seats_taken":0,"seats_taken":0,"wait_list":true,"color":"#F26D04","featured_image":"https://d68g328n4ug0e.cloudfront.net/data/feat_img/138/928/1713189232.jpg","geolocation":null,"future_dates":[],"registration_cost":0,"more_info":"","setup_time":0,"teardown_time":0},{"id":12242010,"title":"Super Searching: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase","allday":false,"start":"2024-06-14T10:10:00-07:00","end":"2024-06-14T11:00:00-07:00","description":"<div id=\"s-lc-event-desc\">\n<p>Let us show you how to get the best results from your search.</p>\n\n<p>Go beyond Google search methods to get a handle on database logic. Build complex search strategies; try some PubMed tricks and tips, and set up alerts to stay informed when new articles are published in your field.</p>\n\n<p>And try two other databases: Web of Science and Embase. In Web of Science you can identify articles, find where an author or article has been cited, and find articles an article has cited. In this database, articles are linked by citations. You can also find &lsquo;hot articles&rsquo; and &lsquo;highly cited articles.&rsquo; These are high-impact articles, receiving so many citations from other articles that they are in the top 1% of articles in their academic field.</p>\n\n<p>Produced by Elsevier Science, Embase covers additional EU literature, so you will find unique citations here that are not in PubMed. It includes all of Medline plus over 2,000 extra titles, and 260,000 conference abstracts (over 24 million records from more than 7,500 journals).

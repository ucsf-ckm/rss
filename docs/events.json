How can women&rsquo;s lived experiences shape what it means to talk about health and wellness in the midst of structural inequality and violence? In a talk that shares excerpts from dozens of oral histories collected with women living with HIV/AIDS and featured on the website, www.stillsurviving.net, Brier will explore how attention to women&rsquo;s history that is always defined by race and class, can help us see how people living with HIV/AIDS have survived and thrived over the course of the last forty years and also imagine ways to share that history with a wide range of audiences. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">About Dr. Brier</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Jennifer Brier&rsquo;s research and teaching are largely focused on exploring the historical intersections of gender, race, and sexuality. Her first book, Infectious Ideas: U.S. Political Response to the AIDS Crisis (University of North Carolina Press, 2009) argues that AIDS provides the perfect lens through which to see the complex social and political history of the 1980s and 1990s. She substantiates this argument by detailing how activists, service providers, philanthropists, and the federal government responded to AIDS in the first two decades of the AIDS epidemic. She places the history of a successful yet complex and contentious social movement organized to deal with the AIDS epidemic in conversation with a more traditional political history of how the state dealt with this public health crisis. Finally, she links the local to the global by connecting the development of domestic AIDS policy and activism to global AIDS policy and activism.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Brier is also actively engaged in producing public history. She co-curated the award-winning exhibition, &quot;Out in Chicago,&quot; on LGBT history in Chicago at the Chicago History Museum as well as Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics and Culture, a traveling exhibition for the National Library of Medicine. Brier is currently leading a team of UIC faculty, students and staff to build a community-curated mobile gallery called History Moves that will provide a space for Chicago-based community organizers and activists to share their histories with a wide audience. &nbsp;The interdisciplinary project has received funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, UIC&rsquo;s Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement (IPCE), Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy (IRRPP), and the Chancellor&rsquo;s Multidisciplinary Discovery Award.</span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\"></span></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><i>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

Through documents from the <a href=\"https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/\">UCSF Industry Documents Library</a> &ndash; including essays by CEOs of Big Oil companies and representatives of the plastics industry, federal legal documents, op-eds from print media, and academic research &ndash; Tabancay crafts a narrative that shows industry and economic practices that negatively impact humans and the environment with climate change as the backdrop.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">As many know, hospitals generate vast amounts of waste, especially plastic. This reality has been a driving force behind the work featured in Tabancay&#39;s exhibition, which has been created using discarded plastic materials obtained from the UCSF medical center. The works reflect the consequences of human reliance on plastic and its impact on Earth&rsquo;s native populations.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The Healthcare industry is the second-largest waste generator in the US after the food industry, producing more than 5 million tons of waste each year. Among them, 85% of the waste is non-infectious and ends up in landfills with only a small fraction being recycled and repurposed .</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><a href=\"https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/sustainability/waste-to-art\">UCSF Sustainability website</a></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Tabancay also explored the UCSF Library&rsquo;s physical archives as part of her residency. As a UCSF School of Medicine graduate, she has firsthand experience observing and using modern medical instruments. She found the vintage medical artifacts and their histories compelling, incorporating them into her research.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The exhibition opening is available to UCSF ID badge holders, and admission is FREE.

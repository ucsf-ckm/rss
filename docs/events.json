Known as the &ldquo;Section 504 Sit-In,&rdquo; the protest profoundly changed the lives of people with and without disabilities, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The &ldquo;Patient No More&rdquo; exhibition is an opportunity for all UCSF students, staff, and faculty to learn about this pivotal moment that led to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) signed 35 years ago on July 26, 1990. Above all, this exhibition reminds all of us that disabilities are a source of creativity and innovation, not pity or tragedy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>This exhibition is on view December 8, 2025 - February 1, 2026.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Location and hours</h2>\n\n<p>This exhibition is located at the Kalmanovitz Library, floor 3 (main floor).</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>UCSF ID badge</strong> holders can view the exhibit 24/7</li>\n\t<li><strong>Public visitors </strong>can view the exhibit Monday&mdash;Friday, 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.*&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*with the exception of winter break,&nbsp;December 22, 2025 through January 2, 2026, and Presidents&#39; Day,&nbsp;Monday, January 19, 2026.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h1>Opening reception</h1>\n\n<p>The opening reception for the exhibit is Monday, December 8, 2025, 3 - 4:30 p.m. at the Kalmanovitz Library. <a href=\"http://tiny.ucsf.edu/E827J8\">Please register to attend.</a><i></i></p>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

This session will provide an overview of key developments, such as the integration of technology in the classroom, the rise of remote and hybrid learning models, and the increasing importance of digital literacy. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities these trends present and share how our institution is actively supporting faculty in navigating these changes. Attendees will learn about new resources, initiatives, and collaborative efforts designed to equip educators with the tools and knowledge they need to thrive in this evolving educational landscape.</p>\n\n<h3>Keynote Presentation | 10:00am - 12:00pm</h3>\n\n<p><strong>C. Edward Watson, Ph.D., </strong>Vice President for Digital Innovation with the American Association of Colleges and Universities</p>\n\n<p>Generative AI tools have had an astonishingly quick impact on the ways we learn, work, think, and create. While higher education&rsquo;s initial response was to develop strategies to diminish AI&rsquo;s influence in the classroom, it is now clear that AI competencies and literacies must be embraced as essential learning for most colleges and universities. These responses and realities create a challenging tension that higher education must work to resolve.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing from the presenter&rsquo;s new book, <a href=\"https://search.library.ucsf.edu/permalink/01UCS_SAF/cjaimd/alma9920701099506531\">Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2024)</a>, this presentation and discussion will detail the challenges and opportunities that have emerged for higher education, especially in terms of pedagogical practice and student engagement. The core focus of this keynote will be on concrete approaches and strategies higher education can adopt, both within the classroom and across larger curricular structures, to best prepare students for the life that awaits them after graduation. It will also detail how faculty can leverage AI to both improve teaching and save time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seats are limited for this in-person session of the Teaching and Learning Symposium.

Traditional health sciences education has focused on providing knowledge as the way to integrate people into an academic community, but data shows that not all people became equally integrated into this academic community, despite knowledge acquisition. With this in mind, Dr. Estrada will describe findings from her research program in which she has longitudinally tracked and examined what types of mentorships, training experiences, and supports result in students integrating into their professional fields and persisting in health sciences career pathways. Her research focuses on the experiences of persons historically excluded because of ethnicity and race. Further, she will describe practical actions that educators and institutions can take to provide kindness cues that affirm social inclusion. These actions can positively impact the integration experience for historically underrepresented college students, faculty, and administrators in health sciences training and professional settings.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h4>Presenter:</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Mica Estrada, PhD, </strong>Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion and Outreach, School of Nursing</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h4>Who Should Join?</h4>\n\n<p>The Symposium is intended for UCSF faculty and anyone supporting academic programs at UCSF.</p>\n\n<h4>Accommodation</h4>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes people with disabilities to our events and programs.

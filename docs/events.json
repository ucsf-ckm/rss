The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming. The series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session requires UCSF MyAccess credentials.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to host intermediate-level workshops on R in&nbsp;Spring 2025 (dates and details pending).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question.

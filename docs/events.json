Through hands-on programming exercises, participants will learn to import tabular data in CSV and Excel format, specify columns, filter by row value, generate summarizations and descriptive statistics, and create pivot tables. This workshop will also introduce the Google Colab programming environment and strategies for, creating, reviewing, and validating code through Google&rsquo;s generative AI coding assistant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This workshop is part of a broader series covering programming for the digital humanities, with an emphasis on document and text analysis.

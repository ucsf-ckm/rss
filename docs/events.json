Known as the &ldquo;Section 504 Sit-In,&rdquo; the protest profoundly changed the lives of people with and without disabilities, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The &ldquo;Patient No More&rdquo; exhibition is an opportunity for all UCSF students, staff, and faculty to learn about this pivotal moment that led to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) signed 35 years ago on July 26, 1990. Above all, this exhibition reminds all of us that disabilities are a source of creativity and innovation, not pity or tragedy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>This exhibition is on view December 8, 2025 - February 1, 2026.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Location and hours</h2>\n\n<p>This exhibition is located at the Kalmanovitz Library, floor 3 (main floor).</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>UCSF ID badge</strong> holders can view the exhibit 24/7</li>\n\t<li><strong>Public visitors </strong>can view the exhibit Monday&mdash;Friday, 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.*&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*with the exception of winter break,&nbsp;December 22, 2025 through January 2, 2026, and Presidents&#39; Day,&nbsp;Monday, January 19, 2026.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h1>Credits</h1>\n\n<p><em>Patient No More: People with Disabilities Securing Civil Rights</em>&nbsp;is presented by the&nbsp;Paul K.

This talk explores a GenAI system&rsquo;s ability to detect smoking imagery in a visually busy &rsquo;80s sci-fi video by breaking the video into 1-second frames and evaluating two prompts: one that encourages detection and one that emphasizes neutrality. Multiple runs of each prompt are compared to examine changes in precision, recall, accuracy, and overall consistency. The session offers a practical look at how prompt phrasing and model variability affect real-world use cases, and what to keep in mind when using GenAI tools for content analysis.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Love Data Week</strong><br />\nUC Love Data Week is a week-long offering of presentations and workshops focused on data access, management, security, sharing, and preservation.

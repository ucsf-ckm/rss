Using characteristics of bacteria and fungi (e.g., shape, color, relative size, flagella, endospores, arrangement, and immunofluorescence), she embroidered microorganisms and set them into Petri dishes. Her series, <em>What&rsquo;s In You and On You: Normal Flora and Pathogens</em>, depicts more than 50 kinds of microorganisms rendered in hand embroidery, identifiable by their stitched characteristics. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">This led to her series, <em>Adapting to New Substrates</em>. Combined with her research into living organisms&rsquo; ability to digest plastic, she created a series of art works of embroidered organisms on various kinds of plastic discards. Mealworms such as <em>Tenebrio molitor</em>, <em>Tenebrio obscurans</em>, and <em>Zophobas morio</em> have been shown to digest polystyrene (Styrofoam); <em>Bacillus pseudofirmus</em>, low density polyethene (LDPE); <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em>, polyethlene terephthalate (PET).</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Accomodations</span></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">UCSF welcomes everyone, including people with disabilities to our events.

Between college and graduate school, Sydney spent three years as a Senior Software Developer in the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s Lifespan Brain Institute where she collaborated with informatics teams around the world to develop software packages and workflows for reproducibly analyzing large neuroimaging datasets.

Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources.

You will receive an email from LibCal with room information and Zoom link prior to the start of the workshop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"color:#000000; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; text-align:start; white-space:normal; text-decoration:none; line-height:1.38; background-color:#ffffff; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-alternates:normal; font-variant-numeric:normal; font-variant-east-asian:normal; font-variant-position:normal; font-variant-emoji:normal; white-space:pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:700\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\">Workshop Series: Data and Document Analysis with Python, SQL, and AI</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p>This series is designed for researchers, staff, and students who want to learn Python from the ground up, focusing on data analysis, document analysis, and AI-based research. Throughout the workshops, we&rsquo;ll dive into various data types&mdash;including numerical data, health data, text, and images/videos&mdash;and explore analysis techniques like regression, classification, and sentiment analysis. We&rsquo;ll put a particular focus on text analysis, especially analyzing documents from our industry document library.</p>\n\n<p>As programming evolves, so does the way we learn it. While we&rsquo;ll introduce AI-assisted programming earlier in the series than in past workshop series, we&rsquo;ll still start with the basics. The early workshops (Intro to Python Parts 1 &amp; 2 and Intro to SQL) will use AI sparingly. As the series moves forward, we&rsquo;ll dive into topics like web APIs, text analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, regression, document analysis, and AI system interaction, with more AI-driven techniques along the way.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","url":{"public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/event/14212861","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/aevent.php?c=928&m=edit&event_id=14212861"},"location":"Virtual","campus":"Online","category":[{"id":27094,"name":"Data Science"},{"id":46333,"name":"Data Science > Programming"}],"owner":{"id":15596,"name":"Geoffrey Boushey"},"presenter":"","calendar":{"id":928,"name":"Library Events and Classes","public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/calendar/events","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/admin/calendar/928"},"seats":70,"registration":true,"registration_form_id":5701,"registration_series_linked":false,"has_registration_opened":true,"has_registration_closed":false,"physical_seats":20,"physical_seats_taken":7,"online_seats":50,"online_seats_taken":32,"seats_taken":39,"wait_list":true,"color":"#058488","featured_image":"https://d68g328n4ug0e.cloudfront.net/data/feat_img/138/928/1741982294.png","geolocation":null,"future_dates":[],"registration_cost":0,"more_info":"","setup_time":0,"teardown_time":0,"online_user_id":0,"zoom_email":"","online_meeting_id":"","online_host_url":"","online_join_url":"https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/99992129260?pwd=E8bgdbUOwj92X9tfet9TSQAamig2qv.1","online_join_password":"E8bgdbUOwj92X9tfet9TSQAamig2qv.1","online_provider":"external"},{"id":14119713,"title":"Needlecraft Monthly Meet-Up","allday":false,"start":"2025-06-13T12:00:00-07:00","end":"2025-06-13T13:00:00-07:00","description":"<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><img alt=\"makers lab logo\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/17525/images/MakersLabLogo-web.png\" style=\"width: 351px; height: 91px;\" /></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></strong></span><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Calling all fans of knitting, crochet, cross-stitch, sewing, and embroidery!</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">This virtual meet-up is a chance for beginning and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">experienced</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"> UCSF crafters&nbsp;to come together and work on their projects in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

Through documents from the UCSF Industry Documents Library &ndash; including essays by CEOs of Big Oil companies and representatives of the plastics industry, federal legal documents, op-eds from print media, and academic research &ndash; Tabancay crafts a narrative that pits industry and economics against humans and the environment with the backdrop of climate change.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">As many are aware, hospitals generate vast amounts of waste, much of it plastic. This reality has been a driving force behind the work featured in <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Tabancay&#39;s</span> exhibition, which has been created using discarded plastic materials obtained from the medical center. The works reflect the consequences of human reliance on plastic and its impact on Earth&rsquo;s native populations.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The Healthcare industry is the second-largest waste generator in the US after the food industry, producing more than 5 million tons of waste each year. Among them, 85% of the waste is non-infectious and ends up in landfills with only a small fraction being recycled and repurposed .</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><a href=\"https://campuslifeserviceshome.ucsf.edu/sustainability/waste-to-art\">UCSF Sustainability website</a></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">As part of her residency, Ruth also explored the UCSF Library&rsquo;s physical archives.

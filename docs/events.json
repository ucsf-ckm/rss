The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming.<br />\n<br />\nThe series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session is required, using UCSF MyAccess.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to host intermediate-level workshops on R in&nbsp;Spring 2025 (dates and details pending).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question. This first session&nbsp;is&nbsp;titled &quot;How can I do math?&quot; and&nbsp;will cover:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>RStudio&#39;s panes</li>\n\t<li>the RStudio console</li>\n\t<li>mathematical operators</li>\n\t<li>mathematical functions</li>\n\t<li>object assignment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please install R and RStudio prior to attendance. Instructions will be sent out via email prior to the session.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Please watch the orientation&nbsp;video prior to attendance. A link will be sent out via email prior to the session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the instructor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The instructor, Yea-Hung Chen, PhD, MS, has 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience teaching R to the UCSF community. He designed and taught UCSF&#39;s first-ever R course (Biostat 213) and&nbsp;taught the introductory biostatistics course for UCSF&#39;s&nbsp;MS in Global Health program (GHS 207).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>Slides will be available on the Course Learning Environment at least 24 hours prior to each session. Learners are welcome to use recording or closed-captioning features embedded in the Zoom platform.&nbsp;To request reasonable accommodation for this session, please email the instructor (yea-hung.chen@ucsf.edu) as soon as possible.</p>","url":{"public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/event/13596014","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/aevent.php?c=928&m=edit&event_id=13596014"},"location":"","campus":"Online","category":[{"id":27094,"name":"Data Science"}],"owner":{"id":141632,"name":"Yea-Hung Chen"},"presenter":"Yea-Hung Chen","calendar":{"id":928,"name":"Library Events and Classes","public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/calendar/events","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/admin/calendar/928"},"seats":50,"registration":true,"registration_form_id":0,"registration_series_linked":false,"has_registration_opened":true,"has_registration_closed":false,"physical_seats":0,"physical_seats_taken":0,"online_seats":50,"online_seats_taken":19,"seats_taken":19,"wait_list":true,"color":"#058488","featured_image":"https://d68g328n4ug0e.cloudfront.net/data/feat_img/138/928/1734998214.png","geolocation":null,"future_dates":[],"registration_cost":0,"more_info":"","setup_time":0,"teardown_time":0,"online_user_id":0,"zoom_email":"","online_meeting_id":"","online_host_url":"","online_join_url":"https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/94716001154?pwd=HrOWgZ4RTVGWt2Eg0PUzPRx7YWqhxx.1","online_join_password":"","online_provider":"external"},{"id":13926374,"title":"Data Science Help Desk","allday":false,"start":"2025-01-28T14:00:00-08:00","end":"2025-01-28T15:00:00-08:00","description":"<h3><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><b>Visit our virtual data science help desk!&nbsp;</b></span></h3>\n\n<p>Introducing the&nbsp;<b>Data Science Help Desk,</b> a place to ask your general questions about data science including how to download software or code packages, prep for upcoming data science&nbsp;classes, get started with programming, connect with data science expertise, and more.

Known as the &ldquo;Section 504 Sit-In,&rdquo; the protest profoundly changed the lives of people with and without disabilities, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The &ldquo;Patient No More&rdquo; exhibition is an opportunity for all UCSF students, staff, and faculty to learn about this pivotal moment that led to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) signed 35 years ago on July 26, 1990. Above all, this exhibition reminds all of us that disabilities are a source of creativity and innovation, not pity or tragedy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>This exhibition is on view December 8, 2025 - February 1, 2026.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Location and hours</h2>\n\n<p>This exhibition is located at the Kalmanovitz Library, floor 3 (main floor).</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>UCSF ID badge</strong> holders can view the exhibit 24/7</li>\n\t<li><strong>Public visitors </strong>can view the exhibit Monday&mdash;Friday, 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.*&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*with the exception of winter break,&nbsp;December 22, 2025 through January 2, 2026, and Presidents&#39; Day,&nbsp;Monday, January 19, 2026.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h1>Opening reception</h1>\n\n<p>The opening reception for the exhibit is Monday, December 8, 2025, 3 - 4:30 p.m. at the Kalmanovitz Library. <a href=\"http://tiny.ucsf.edu/E827J8\">Please register to attend.</a><i></i></p>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

Copying and pasting results into tables can be tedious, particularly because the data and analytic decisions may often be changing, necessitating seemingly endless repetition of the copy-and-paste process. This workflow is not just tiring; it is also prone to human error. It is easy, for example, to lose track of whether a table reflects the most recent changes to data analysis.</p>\n\n<p>In this workshop, we&#39;ll introduce <em>gtsummary</em>, a popular package for creating and exporting tables directly from R. Tools like <em>gtsummary</em> can help you automate the creation of tables, eliminating the need to copy and paste.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The session will include short presentations, interspersed with hands-on exercises. We encourage you to bring your own projects so you can practice using <em>gtsummary</em> to make tables for your own work during the hands-on exercises!</p>\n\n<p>This session does assume some familiarity with R. However, we aim to be accessible, and try to minimize assumptions about your experience with R!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the series</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the first session in the&nbsp;<em>Sharing R Results</em>&nbsp;series.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

Copying and pasting results into documents or slide decks can be tedious, particularly because the data and analytic decisions may often be changing, necessitating seemingly endless repetition of the copy-and-paste process. This workflow is not just tiring; it is also prone to human error. It is easy, for example, to lose track of whether a document or slide deck reflects the most recent changes to data analysis.</p>\n\n<p>In this workshop, we&#39;ll introduce Quarto, a popular tool for writing documents and slide decks. Quarto allows you to include R code within documents, so that you don&#39;t need to copy and paste results.</p>\n\n<p>The session will include short presentations, interspersed with hands-on exercises. We encourage you to bring your own projects so you can practice using Quarto to summarize your own work during the hands-on exercises!</p>\n\n<p>This session does assume some familiarity with R. However, we aim to be accessible, and try to minimize assumptions about your experience with R!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the series</strong></p>\n\n<p>The session is the second in a new occasional series, <em>Sharing R Results</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

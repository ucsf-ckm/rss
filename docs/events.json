The series is designed for UCSF researchers who intend to begin using&nbsp;R in their research. The series&nbsp;is intended to be a (relatively) slow-paced introduction to R. It does not assume any prior exposure to R or computer programming.<br />\n<br />\nThe series has been designed to help learners approach&nbsp;common&nbsp;data-related&nbsp;tasks, and will&nbsp;draw on data examples from the health sciences (including public health and medicine).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each session (scheduled for 1.5 hours, but we may finish earlier on occasion) will involve short mini lectures, interspersed with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Registration for each session is required, using a UCSF account.</p>\n\n<p>We are likely to follow this introductory-level series with intermediate-level sessions (tentatively in Spring 2025).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the session</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each session is titled in the form of a &quot;How can I...&quot; question. This first session&nbsp;is&nbsp;titled &quot;How can I do math?&quot; and&nbsp;will cover:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>RStudio&#39;s panes</li>\n\t<li>the RStudio console</li>\n\t<li>mathematical operators</li>\n\t<li>mathematical functions</li>\n\t<li>object assignment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please install R and RStudio prior to attendance. Instructions will be sent out via email prior to the session.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Please watch the orientation&nbsp;video prior to attendance. A link will be sent out via email prior to the session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the instructor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The instructor, Yea-Hung Chen, PhD, MS, has roughly 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience teaching R to the UCSF community. He designed and taught UCSF&#39;s first-ever R course (Biostat 213) and&nbsp;taught the introductory biostatistics course for UCSF&#39;s&nbsp;MS in Global Health program (GHS 207).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disability statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>Slides will be available on the Course Learning Environment at least 24 hours prior to each session.

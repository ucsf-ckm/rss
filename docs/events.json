In Web of Science you can identify articles, find where an author or article has been cited, and find articles an article has cited. In this database, articles are linked by citations.

The reception will be held on the main floor of the UCSF Kalmanovitz Library on the Parnassus Heights campus and will include an overview of the exhibition and a conversation with the artist.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">This exhibition visually translates the destructive herbicide glyphosate into chemically deteriorated images and an interactive augmented reality (AR) experience reflecting on its consequences to body and land. Throughout Katina&#39;s residency at UCSF, she reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/chemical/collections/roundup-litigation-documents/\"><em>Roundup Litigation Documents</em></a> within the UCSF Industry Documents Library to select the most poignant parts of the email exchanges between the Environmental Protection Agency and Monsanto. She included the written exchanges in her photographic project where she used glyphosate to physically deteriorate C-prints over time as they were buried in the ground. Additionally, she used images from her personal archive of her family&rsquo;s land that underwent the same treatment and process. The results of these prints varied from partially deteriorated, highlighting specific sections of the print, to completely disintegrated, leaving behind a ghost-like image.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Additional components of the exhibition</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">An <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">augmented reality (AR)</span> project then takes the patterns created by the deterioration process and animates them into a virtual work, enabling the viewer to place the deterioration on top of their inhabited land to visualize the detrimental effects instantly. A series of letterpress prints also feature the deterioration patterns from the glyphosate-treated images and segments of a lake depth map of Burt Lake, a frequented fishing spot in northern Michigan. The letterpress prints comment on the effects herbicides have on our aquatic ecosystems. The deterioration patterns conceal and highlight various indication symbols on the map, that guide the viewer.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The exhibition opening is open to UCSF ID badge holders and admission is FREE.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></strong></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">UCSF welcomes everyone, including people with disabilities to our events.

Build complex search strategies; try some PubMed tricks and tips, and set up alerts to stay informed when new articles are published in your field.</p>\n\n<p>And try two other databases: Web of Science and Embase. In Web of Science you can identify articles, find where an author or article has been cited, and find articles an article has cited. In this database, articles are linked by citations. You can also find &lsquo;hot articles&rsquo; and &lsquo;highly cited articles.&rsquo; These are high-impact articles, receiving so many citations from other articles that they are in the top 1% of articles in their academic field.</p>\n\n<p>Produced by Elsevier Science, Embase covers additional EU literature, so you will find unique citations here that are not in PubMed. It includes all of Medline plus over 2,000 extra titles, and 260,000 conference abstracts (over 24 million records from more than 7,500 journals).

The Help Desk is hosted by graduate student TAs of the Data Science Team twice a week on Tuesdays&nbsp;and Wednesdays from 2-3 pm subject to change to fit the needs of the UCSF community. Due to current COVID-19 guidelines, the Help Desk will be hosted on Zoom, but in-person Data Science&nbsp;Help Desk services at Mission Bay/Parnassus campuses may take place in the future. The Data Science&nbsp;Help Desk is open to the UCSF community including faculty, staff, and trainees.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to meeting you (virtually) at the Data Science&nbsp;Help Desk!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>Access Help Desk:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/98677502980?pwd=dmRzMkpNTmdPdEtBZmg1SVNLU0tXUT09\">Zoom Link</a></strong></span></p>","url":{"public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/event/12433931","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/aevent.php?c=928&m=edit&event_id=12433931"},"location":"","campus":"Online","category":[{"id":57369,"name":"Data Science > Help Desk"},{"id":46333,"name":"Data Science > Programming"},{"id":27094,"name":"Data Science"}],"owner":{"id":91455,"name":"Fred Jiang"},"presenter":"Fred Jiang & James Lim","calendar":{"id":928,"name":"Library Events and Classes","public":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/calendar/events","admin":"https://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/admin/calendar/928"},"seats":"","registration":false,"color":"#058488","featured_image":"https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/128689/images/LibraryNavyBox.png","geolocation":null,"future_dates":[],"registration_cost":0,"more_info":"","setup_time":0,"teardown_time":0,"online_user_id":0,"zoom_email":"","online_meeting_id":"","online_host_url":"","online_join_url":"https://ucsf.zoom.us/j/98677502980?pwd=dmRzMkpNTmdPdEtBZmg1SVNLU0tXUT09","online_join_password":"","online_provider":"external"},{"id":11658506,"title":"Needlecraft Monthly Meet-Up","allday":false,"start":"2024-09-13T12:00:00-07:00","end":"2024-09-13T13:00:00-07:00","description":"<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><img alt=\"makers lab logo\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/17525/images/MakersLabLogo-web.png\" style=\"width: 351px; height: 91px;\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"></span></strong></span><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Calling all fans of knitting, crochet, cross-stitch, sewing, and embroidery!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">This virtual meet-up is a chance for beginning and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">experienced</span><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"> UCSF crafters&nbsp;to come together and work on their projects in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

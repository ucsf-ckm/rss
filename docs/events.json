Her leadership roles include co-leading the March of Dimes preterm birth research data repository and directing the UCSF AI4ALL program, which teaches AI to underrepresented youth.</div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\">This talk will be centered around the development and administration of a March of Dimes-funded public data-sharing repository for preterm birth research, emphasizing its role in promoting open science and collaboration. She will discuss the organization of a DREAM crowdsourcing challenge that leveraging data from this repository and other publicly available datasets with the goal of predicting preterm risk among expectant individuals. The session will demonstrate how open data initiatives can accelerate discovery in preterm birth.</div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"zm-col zm-col-6\" data-v-1729b4aa=\"\">The Bay Area Open Science Group is intended to bring together students, faculty, and staff from the Stanford, UCSF, and Berkeley community to learn about open science, discuss the application of open science practices in a research context, and meet other members of the community who are interested in (or already are) incorporating open science practices into their work.

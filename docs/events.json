This talk explores a GenAI system&rsquo;s ability to detect smoking imagery in a visually busy &rsquo;80s sci-fi video by breaking the video into 1-second frames and evaluating two prompts: one that encourages detection and one that emphasizes neutrality. Multiple runs of each prompt are compared to examine changes in precision, recall, accuracy, and overall consistency. The session offers a practical look at how prompt phrasing and model variability affect real-world use cases, and what to keep in mind when using GenAI tools for content analysis.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Love Data Week</strong><br />\nUC Love Data Week is a week-long offering of presentations and workshops focused on data access, management, security, sharing, and preservation.

We will begin by presenting notable examples of hallucinations&mdash;false or misleading information&mdash;and summarizing research on the topic. We will offer some possible techniques for minimizing hallucination. Finally, we will open the floor for you to offer reactions to several guided questions.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Summarize some of the research on hallucination</li>\n\t<li>Apply prompt-engineering techniques to minimize hallucination</li>\n\t<li>Formulate strategies for assessing AI output</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.

Copying and pasting results into documents or slide decks can be tedious, particularly because the data and analytic decisions may often be changing, necessitating seemingly endless repetition of the copy-and-paste process. This workflow is not just tiring; it is also prone to human error. It is easy, for example, to lose track of whether a document or slide deck reflects the most recent changes to data analysis.</p>\n\n<p>In this workshop, we&#39;ll introduce Quarto, a popular tool for writing documents and slide decks. Quarto allows you to include R code within documents, so that you don&#39;t need to copy and paste results.</p>\n\n<p>The session will include short presentations, interspersed with hands-on exercises. We encourage you to bring your own projects so you can practice using Quarto to summarize your own work during the hands-on exercises!</p>\n\n<p>This session does assume some familiarity with R. However, we aim to be accessible, and try to minimize assumptions about your experience with R!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the series</strong></p>\n\n<p>The session is the second in a new occasional series, <em>Sharing R Results</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>UCSF welcomes all participants to our events.
